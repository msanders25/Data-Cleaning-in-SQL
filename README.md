# Data Cleaning Project


## Project Overview
#### The purpose of this project was to display my process for cleaning a dataset and getting it ready for data analysis. The dataset that I found to clean contains historical attendance numbers of open gym sessions at community centers in Cary North Carolina. I chose this dataset to clean after viewing its original form and seeing all the data crammed into two columns which presented a good opportunity to showcase cleaning techniques. 

The original data can be found at this link
